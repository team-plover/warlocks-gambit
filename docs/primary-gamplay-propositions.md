# Magic soccer

## Pitch

You are a team of apprentice wizards who more or less by accident got into
the big league tournament of the zorrard game. (probably due to a upset such
as a mysterious new disease disabling most teams)

Zorrard is a team game of 5v5. There is a ball, each team must defend their
gate, and you must shoot the ball in the opponent's team gate! (sound
familiar eh?) You are only allowed to use your feet, and magic spells.

The difference between the small league and big league players is that the
big league wizards are very high level and use spells like "summon large demo",
"blizzard" or "night of the walking deads". Your team's wizard only know
the basic magic 101 spells such as "fireball", "invisibility", "illusion".

Can you overcome this unfair advantage?

## Gameplay

Mostly AI driven. Player controls movement of single character in a single
team and can swap control freely between characters in his team.

Each character has two spell slots. The available spells may vary between
characters. The cooldown on spell is per character.

There is a "team spell" (like an ultimate move) that requires that certain
conditions are met to use.

There is a key mapped to (a) shooting the ball (b) using spell 1 (c) using
spell 2 (d) using the "team spell".

Left stick (or WASD) is mapped to movement of the controlled character, right
stick (or mouse pointer) is mapped to "_auxiliary_ controlled character". An
_auxiliary_ character is selected when hovered with mouse cursor or pointed
at by the right stick (relative to controlled character).

Pressing (a) when no _auxiliary_ is selected will simply shoot the ball in
the direction the controlled character is facing. Pressing (a) when an
_auxiliary_ is selected will perform a pass and swap player control to the
_auxiliary_. Pressing (a) when controlled character doesn't have the ball
will do the player control change without passing.

Pressing (b,c) with no _auxiliary_ will activate the spell for the controlled
wizard. Pressing (b,c) when _auxiliary_ is selected will trigger the
_auxiliary_'s spell.

The trick to for the player to win is to notice that the spells used by the
strong wizards may look intimidating but are not as useful if you know your
way around them.


# Wizard's Battle

Game has a premise similar to Battle (the card game, War in the US, but we
use Battle to avoid trademark infringement). However each draw is 3 cards and
you get to chose which card to play until the 3 cards are exhausted and you
draw again.

You play against a pigeon and a blindfolded man with a pointy hat and a eye
drawn on the blindfold.

Your card suit is not the usual suite, but a deck of magic words. Each word
has a value and a color (four color totals). There are some quirks that makes
the game more interesting than the base Battle game (like maybe a
rock/paper/scissor mechanic).

## Gameplay

As in Battle, the goal is to accumulate as many cards as possible, at the end
the magic words form a pentacle that summons a demon, and the one with the
most magic words is the largest and beats the other.

The game starts exactly like Battle... Apart that you'll soon notice your
deck is the lower half of values while your opponents is the upper half! They
just so happen to have sorted themselves the deck prior. You lose quickly and
you restart.

Now game shows a prompt that tells you to "hide" a card while "the pigeon is
not looking". You hide it, then you get a prompt to "reuse" at the next draw.
It's a sort of quicktime event so that you can store a card between turns. If
you fail to properly put back the card in your hand while drawing, you get
noticed and the pigeon use his eye lasers to kill you. *(Note by blucky: I think eye lasers would be out of place but since it's a bird an option would be to have the pigeon peck you or something, or have it fly up to reveal claws that would fit a predatory bird more than a pigeon with which it will kill you.
Another concern would be lives: should we instakill or should the pigeon cause injury first and then kill if you mess up too much?)*
*(gib: I think the pigeon should flutter and make noise to make the blindfold wizard notice you and they say something like "cheater be gone!")*
*(vasukas: Good thing about eye lasers is that no-one will expect that! And it should be faster to do than pecking animation and way cooler than just game over screen)*

Each "run" should be about 5 minutes. The first one where you lose by default should be at most 2 minutes. Each cheat mistake is fatal and you should be able to restart very quickly.

There are more than one trick. Some are classic tricks like marking, putting
back in the deck etc. Some of them include magic (like making a card
invisible or duplicating or swapping with enemy hand or picking from enemy
deck). The magic tricks can be spotted by the blindfolded man while the
physical tricks by the pigeon. You have to somehow get them to be distracted
to pull the tricks.
